When life is busy it is so important to find things that you enjoy and that bring you joy. For me that could be may different things, a cosy blanket and cuddles with the dog, Tea and crochet or enjoying the best that autumn had to offer like fresh apple pie and custard. But after a long week it is so important to get out and about while the weather is still amenable and enjoy the last warm of the autumn sunshine before winter settles in.

The autumn is undeniably here, but the last throws of summer colours still linger on. This weekend we visited both Grey Court and Basildon Park National trust with the children and the dog making the most of crisp leaves and sticks to play with. From the bright reds pinks and oranges of the Dahlias and vibrant purples of the verbenas at Greys court to the subtle beautiful roses at Basildon the colour combinations are truly wonderful and inspiring.

At the same time adventures into the woodland yielded piles of delicate mushrooms, hiding tucked up in blankets of crisp orange leaves, acorns, spikey sweet chestnut shells and abundant sloes and guilder roses in the hedge rows.

It is a great privilege to try to capture the warm and comfort of autumnal adventures and vibrant colourful tones of late summer in something that can be both practical and beautiful, and it is something that surely makes my heart happy.

Whatever the weather, let this be a reminder to adventure and to find the beauty all around us and be inspired by all that this time of year truly has to offer.
