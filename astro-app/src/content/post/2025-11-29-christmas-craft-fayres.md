Christmas has always been the busiest, yet my absolute favourite time of year. Call me mad, but this year I've signed up for a total of 5 different Oxfordshire craft fayres in only 4 weeks.. Which is not easy when you have to hand-make all the stock you see before you!

But there is something magical to getting to meet so many wonderful people, and there is no substitute to getting to see people feel just as excited about my latest creations as I was coming up with them!

If you've found this page after meeting me there, then hello again! Otherwise I look forward to seeing you out and about in the coming month!
